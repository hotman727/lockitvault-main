LockItVault Ideas:
1) Fix the search option to the folder contents page. Possibly add one to the recycle bin also?
2) Restore and Permanently Delete buttons in the Recycle Bin Section of Folder Contents
3) Fix the upload bar in the upload template
4) 2 factor authentication login
5) Share a folder (with options for how long the share link will remain active).
6) Create a sub-folder option (and be able to share it, which includes the contents within it).
7) Create a max size limitation for the free users (2 gigs - Same as DropBox).
8) Move files option in the vault (to allow the users to move files around into various folders).
9) Admin analytics (showing number of users, total storage, possibly geographical users (map with some indication of where the users are located, etc)). 
10) Multi-language support. 
11) Social media login options.
12) Notification feed (just a button/logo in teh upper right-hand corner of the header that when clicked shows what recently happened, 'successsssful login at 13:53', 'successfully uploaded file <name>', etc). 
13) Dynamic pages that allow the site to work better on different sized desktops (right now it looks really good on a 1920x1880 monitor, but.... smaller screens it doesn't look great due to how the site was built (my bad... I didn't account for this)). 
14) Document conversion options (.docx to pdf, .png to .jpeg, etc). 
15) AI integrations (summarize selected document, translate documents, answer questions from the contents of documents in a folder, etc).
