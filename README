S3 Folder Sync Tool

This tool monitors a local folder and synchronizes its contents with an S3 bucket. It provides a CLI interface to start/stop monitoring, check status, update configuration, perform manual synchronization, and view logs.
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    boto3
    watchdog
    tqdm

Installation
